# Figure map (paper ↔ repository)

This repository reproduces the *numerical* results of the simulation-first paper:

> Antonios Valamontes (2026), *Loofah-Templated Biomorphic Carbon Superconducting Composites: A Simulation-Driven Platform for Percolation-Controlled Transport Predictions*.

## Main manuscript

- **Workflow schematic**: produced in the LaTeX manuscript as a TikZ figure (not generated by code).
  - `main.tex` → `Figure: Computational workflow` (TikZ block)

## Numerical figures and tables

If you add paper figures that plot percolation/transport results, the recommended mapping is:

- **Percolation transition vs. coating continuity**:
  - Notebook: `notebooks/04_Parameter_Sweep.ipynb`
  - Script: `scripts/run_sweep.py` (CLI sweep driver)
  - Output: `results/sweep.json`

- **Single-case network summary / sanity check**:
  - Notebook: `notebooks/02_Coating_and_Percolation.ipynb`
  - Script: `scripts/make_one_case.py`

- **Critical current (Ic) scaling / bottleneck effects**:
  - Notebook: `notebooks/03_Transport_and_Ic.ipynb`

## Where to record paper-specific outputs

- Store paper outputs under `results/` and commit only small JSON summaries.
- Large artifacts (many realizations) should be regenerated from the notebooks/scripts.
